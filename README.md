#Window App for electronic point of sale (EPOS)
I have created a well-designed electronic point of sale (EPOS) application for use by their counter staff in processing customer orders.

##Flow
Each outlet offers sixteen different gourmet bagels, each of which is available to order in five
different sizes. With such a large array of gourmet bagels and
sizes, the head office management team are particularly focused on ensuring that it has consistency in
pricing across its outlets, and that each outlet keeps an accurate live count of its stock on hand. To this
end, each outlet is supplied with a master bagel pricing list which the EPOS application must load as it
starts. The application must also be able to keep a live count of stock and produce a formatted stock
report which is saved to file that can be viewed by local management or forwarded to head office by
email if and when requested (The current pricing and opening stock levels are supplied in addition to
this document).
